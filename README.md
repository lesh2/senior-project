The webscraper is able to take a teams website, go through every game they played in a season and through all the years they have avaliable. I chose to only look at conference games and do the past 5 seasons. The biggest problem is that theturnovers on special teams are difficult to account for because of how the play-by-play and drive chart account for them. They get added to the teams defense and affect the opposing teams offense. The calculation of the plus minus is only as good as the information avaliable. So this means if a block does not show up in the play by play or there are inconcistencies in labeling it will throw of the calculations. Currently analyzes 645 games from the SAA, NWC, WIAC, and CCIW.
